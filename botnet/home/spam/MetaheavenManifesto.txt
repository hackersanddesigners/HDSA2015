We are designing surface. Surface multiplies, beyond any measure of
necessity, beyond the laws of demand and supply, beyond reason. The
multiplication of surface, formerly called information overload, is the new
reality of design. Its unit of measurement is virtual.
Surface is not territory. Territory, which is actual and geographical (for
that reason limited in supply), can be contested and may become the
site of an actual conflict, a physical confrontation. This cannot happen
on, or to, a surface. Surface is to territory what speculative capital is
to gold. Surface may be multiplied without encountering the physical
limitations imposed by someone else’s terrain, opinion, presence or
personality. If surface is a kind of place, or site, the designer is its
geographer.
Surface is folded out in order to produce value, while it is folded in
to secure it. The production of surface is design’s equivalent to the
production of space; surface in the generic sense means flat space to
display. Surface is anorexic, hyper-thin architecture.
Surface, representing no particular meaning or message, is the
precondition for virtual capital, projected revenue and speculative value.
Advertising surface in public space initially is merely an add-on to the
already existing historical structure of a city. Gradually, surface replaces
the primacy of historical structure and its territoriality. The city becomes
the profit base of a virtual spin: the multiplication of surface accounts for
the exponential growth of value extracted from its public space. By our
being in public, by simple existence, we already automatically affirm the
exposure which grants the surface infrastructure its right to the city. The
inhabitants of cities are, through this mechanism, directly inscribed into
the means of value production.
Mute (passive) surface is classified by the informational properties
of the materials it is composed of. Titanium informs differently from
plastic, while seamless, uninterrupted black marble informs differently
from fractured and broken pieces of stained cardboard. A plastic credit
card which says ‘Gold’ or ‘Platinum’ has understood correctly that the
informational properties of surface do not need correspond to its material
worth. Surface is a transformation of the valueless into the valuable by
means of psychological deception.
The image of a stock market crash is a bursting bubble, the moment
when the virtual character of the capital base of virtual counterparts and
derivative value is exposed.
The surface equivalent to the stock market crash is the Hollows.
The Hollows is surface without surface, the exposure of the naked
infrastructure or root level system language which precedes surface
itself, surface without its effects.
The American Express ‘black card’ is a piece of surface only available
to the ultra privileged. Beyond the symbolism of precious metals, it
takes the concept of value to its decisive, post-material (virtual) stage.
The black card is made of titanium so it is durable rather than valuable.
A world of virtual class distinction inhabits the card with its optional
concierge and butler services.
As a masthead for surface, ‘black is the new gold’ declares the structural
redefinition of the symbols of elite and luxury (and its opposite: poverty).
Black surfaces form a continuum. The black in different kinds of objects
for all kinds of different functions is the continuum of the single sign value
of ‘luxury’. It disjoints the colour black from its material properties in each
separate object, transforming surface into information.
Black surface belongs to the city’s cultural and financial core, the urban
tissue which concentrates decision making and spending capacity and
connects to other such cores. The victim of surface is the periphery (in
virtual terms: off surface) which is declared nonexistent. Peripheries start
where the surfaces begin to crack. The resulting logic is that a periphery,
which is thus deprived of virtual assets, is gradually also denied of its
infrastructural facilities. This process runs exactly parallel to the ranking
systems which favour the well-connected virtual spheres on the internet
over the detached twins at the outer limits.
The immaterial workers were positioned around an open-air swimming
pool on the top floor of a multi-storey private members club in the most
trendy area of a global capital of finance and creative services. The
labourers were sipping cocktails (Flirtinis) to the electronic heartbeat of
anonymous synthi-house of unending duration. The workers, ‘dressed
to kill’ in black Comme des Garçons, black Prada, black Jilsander, black
Burberry, black Balenciaga and black Dior, had bought themselves
into their belief. That belief was that they were the elite. Nowhere else
had a city been so profoundly transformed by the intricate workings of
capital. Skyrocketing real estate prices had made mere living here an
impossibility. The creative class of immaterial labourers had responded
to this by a great leap forward; they had financialized their own
appearance, virtually bridging their class gap. The immaterial workers
were designers. They made surfaces. They consumed and produced on
the same plane, which was the surface. The motionless water surface
of the rooftop pool. The bare concrete, Miesian surface of the walls.
The black bags. The shiny black leather of clothes and shoes. The
Blackberry phones (black, of course). The screensavers and desktops
on the screens of the Blackberries.
The new elite was founded on debt, was into black, and lived in the
former social housing estates. The old elite (now stuffed) was founded
on gold, diamonds, noble titles and fox hunting, and used words like
‘preposterous’. It inhabited monuments.
Communicative (active) surface, or screen, is classified by its capacity
to reveal and open up doorways to virtual worlds. In the absence of
message, it maintains a system of placeholders and default images.
Mobile phones – which physically resemble minimalist jewellery – are
inhabited by complex worlds appearing on the surface of their screens.
In fact a phone is no longer a phone, as it performs the functions of
an email tool, a web browser, an agenda, a calculator, an alarm clock,
a video player, a camera and a game console. There is no principal
difference between the ‘phone-as-surface’ with its inherent capacities to
organize information and social relations, and the ‘credit card-as-surface’
with its capacity to order concierges and butlers.
Active surfaces are inhabited by worlds in worlds. This is a matter
of calculus and inner complexity; mobile phones have surpassed
the threshold between a dedicated machine (designed to perform a
single task or series of tasks) and a machine which appropriates the
functions and tasks previously assigned to other machines, resulting in
the emptying out of the objects that were formerly machines (like the
wristwatch). The system which inhabits the object with the most active
surface – the more informational, complex, all-inclusive one – has
surpassed a degree of complexity, so that the tasks it performs can no
longer be related to its size, its form or its weight.
Design has become the creation and management of virtual assets
attached to objects (like tags, or services) or existing within objects (like
worlds, or doorways).
‘User-generated content’ is a common internet term referring to what
began as the add-on to a given piece of content that is rooted in the oldfashioned 
producer-consumer dichotomy. After the early internet, whichhad ‘home pages’ to ‘surf to’ – distinct locations within a geography – the
social networking site and its user-generated content transforms and
includes the formerly dispersed home pages into a single surface. Inside
this surface, worlds exist in worlds, scenes in scenes, friends in friends,
based on the reciprocal addition of more surface and more doorways to
your friends and your friends’ friends surface as a mutually empowering
social act. On this form of organized activity rests the macro-scale
corporate appropriation of its projected revenues.
Surfaces extend everywhere, recuperating the potentiality for conflicts
by offering more space for the uncontested expansion of self-referential
opinion. The actual confrontation between adversaries is prevented
from taking place, thus suspending the political. The potentiality for a
conflict to occur directly produces production – that is, it perpetuates the
immanent breeding ground for new spheres and strata, new identities,
new aesthetic needs and thus new spaces for production, combined
with a permanent process of tagging. Precisely the tags, or names
(which have passed through preceding stages of evaluation) enable
the transformation of cultural clashes into capital accumulation. This
is the true power of surface, as the multiplication of virtual surfaces
is a frictionless event. This mechanism maintains itself only because
endless coexistence equals the permanent potential for conflicts. This
is the opposite model to the real and the physical, where the natural
rule perpetually refuses the territorial coexistence of incompatible
alternatives.Surface is the reincarnation of neutrality. Default friends, default
faces, default desktops, default writing. In the world of surface, the
confrontation with harsh realities, such as having no face, or no friends,
becomes mediated and softened by the presence of placeholders, which
become the new symbols for absence. Placeholders also possess the
surface capability of gradually overwriting original structures and original
texts.
‘Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do ut
labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

(Text in placeholder Latin, 2008)
Software does precisely what its name spells out: it softens the
relationship between man and manufacture. Writing, visiting friends,
searching, finding, saving: what once required at least some physical
activity becomes extremely light, pleasant and effortless.
Such a soft regime presents itself as unconstrained and plural. While
it seems to cross all territorial boundaries, software rather functions
as escapism and synchronizes employment and pleasure over, and
against, labour and life. It is because software presents itself as a neutral
matter, as a non-directed and infinite open space, that the question
of access and circulation in such an infinite void of potentiality arises.
The spectacle of participation calls upon an undifferentiated behaviour
where egalitarian enactments often smell like indifference and tend to
obey rules of engagement that explicitly remain unwritten. Far from a no
man’s land, the matrix of virtual tools, it independently establishes new
relations and hierarchies among people, which are inevitably paired with
impossibilities and hegemonies.
In the continuum of surfaces, the mechanisms that define the relations
between products, needs and values are transformed. The point of
no return is the vanishing of those categories as separate entities
and the construction of a continuum where any object (material or
immaterial) may have a threefold incarnation as product, need and
value. The result is the simultaneous abolition of distinctions between
production and consumption: when products generate needs, when
needs trigger speculative value and when values are embodied by
products, we can no longer speak of pure consumption, as consumption
itself becomes a productive force, as was already the case already for
Marx. Consumption directly creates new needs, calls for continuous reevaluation (financial or symbolic), and motorizes production.
Whether recognized as labour, as entertainment, or as social interaction,
the activities of consumers, end-users, designers and managers all
are non-dissociable from their corresponding value as producers. The
invention and subsequent emergence of a ‘creative class’ marks the
transition to a genuinely ‘post-work’ understanding of labour, where
labourers and consumers are invited to double their potential in value
accumulation. The speculative value of this incentive equalizing
production and consumption is used in various ways: to create and
sustain new systems of management, to revamp derelict city quarters,
or to justify operations evacuated from political choice. What becomes
key is the designer’s most imaginary reach; to exceed any material
limitation, which enables him or her to dismiss function and to redirect
the evaluation procedure to a new domain. ‘Added value’, after function,
becomes the battle zone of a new regime that capitalizes on speculation.
The flight towards the ‘new’ is paralleled with an ever-growing distance
to the immediate needs of the designer’s direct environment. We
have moved from mediation – operating between products and
consumers – to a much wider suppression of the legitimacy of direct
relations to the point at which it seems that designers would rather
gain credibility through their disconnection and distance from the
physical. Relationships reach the designer as images; just as a brand
manages the relationships that we have with objects through their
image. Nevertheless we see this distance not as a burden, but rather
as privileged ground where ideas may come to life, and so forth. This
imaginary take on reality immediately produces new phantasms that
can be interpreted as valid needs and beginnings for the production
of surface. Designers – either by marketing or by fiction – perpetually
innovate the seductive regime of surface, which stimulates other
designers to do the same thing, disconnected from the non-negotiability
of the brutal material ground, historical structure and political struggles
on which, originally, surface itself was premised.

White Night
Value
0:00 AM
We are not useful.
Some examples:
At the 2007 Millionaire Fair in Moscow a diamond-plated Swarovski
Mercedes Benz was unveiled. It looked monstrous.
The Wenger Swiss Army Knife – a symbol of functionality and minimalism
– now comes in a new and expanded version. The Wenger Ultimate
Swiss Army Knife has no less than 85 tools. It looks bizarre.
Use value and exchange value are not absolute, but eventually relative
phenomena. An absolute exchange value, actualized through the excess
of material worth in a design object, is so ostensibly valuable that it is
cheap. An absolute use value, achieved by cramming every imaginable
functionality into a tool, is so obviously useful that it is useless.
Rob Walker wrote in The New York Times Magazine on the diverging
paths of function and value, using ‘nonfunctional watches’ as an example.
Here function and value separate as there are now such a wide variety of
devices with which we can read the time, such as the mobile telephone.
This condition does not lead to the disappearance of the watch, but to
a redefinition of its value. The watch, or its remainder, becomes a piece
of jewellery dedicated to a phantom function. Now that we already know
what time it is, the watch can dedicate itself completely to aesthetics,
celebrity, poetry and water resistance. The Timeless Bracelet, designed
by Ina Seifart in 2006, is a watch without a watch, a metal bracelet
that consists of an empty, watch-shaped metal frame. This ‘timepiece’
captures how design may reflect upon large-scale changes (and
incoherences) in its function and its value. Its designer, who worked at
Louis Vuitton before starting her own studio, uses the disappearance of
use value to anticipate a new need for another level of added value.
We embrace the realm of added or speculative value that is attached to
objects. It is not the objects themselves, but the values inhabiting them
that are fundamentally reshaped or reinvented. Objects are inhabited by
values, and are at the same time, plastered or covered by them. While a
laptop or a mobile phone may be ‘inhabited’ by new values through the
actions that are performed with them, those values are not registered in
the objects’ titanium shells, which curiously mimic a Dieter Rams-style
simplicity from the era in which an apparatus was a dedicated machine.
Compare a laptop or mobile phone that is made in China, which is
inhabited with transgression and plastered with an impeccable surface,
to the outer shell of the Guggenheim Bilbao – a surface inscribed with all
kinds of values but inhabited by a conventional museum programme.
The categories of inside and outside have become completely
disconnected; like the arrival and departure gates of an airport, they
register the global flows that design is now part of. The difference
between outside and inside, and between form and content, administers
these flows. There is little coherence in the insides and outsides of
design objects and the ways in which they are programmed. As with
the templates and placeholders for web 2.0-style internet pages, they
may be inhabited by all kinds of values that account for the endless
transformation of surface.
Design philosophies that treat form and content as a coherent set,
have trouble in explaining what is going on today. We tend to design
so that form and content may obey different regimes. Every part of
‘surface architecture’ – with its structurally identical insides that cater to
the desires of the real estate market – is bargained over with different
contractors in order to achieve the cheapest possible deal on materials
and construction. These builidngs contain kilometres of fibreglass cables
in order to secure a vital lifeline to the information highway. Finally, the
surface, which poses as the building’s sign value, is intended to obscure
the standardized template. These processes that are vital to the physical
and virtual creation of design, register forces which go beyond factors
specific to local situation and context. Every designed artefact bears
witness to the large scale incoherence of its productive conditions.
It is clear that design is not just political, but primarily geopolitical; the
new shapes and forms may arise haphazardly and by chance, but
they register (in a quite formidable way) the geopolitical forces of the
globalizing world.
Categories like ‘good design’ have become less valid as a way of
speaking about objects which all have a hardware and a software
aspect to them, an inside and an ourside, a modality of inhabitation
and a modality of surface, which each obey different rules. Addressing
these categories as the incoherent parts of a coherent whole means
overcoming the contradistinction between form and content. Coherence
in design today exists primarily in the recognition of large-scale
incoherence.
An exhibition in a design hotel.
At first the hotel was completely designed (by designers).
Now the exhibition consists of changes to the hotel’s design. The
changes are made by artists.
A given situation, once it has been designed, turns out to be
unsatisfactory simply because it is there; it is, among other things, no
longer ‘new’. Then a change has to be incorporated into that situation
without rejecting it completely. It must be ‘altered’ – customized – not
destroyed, by which our desire to reject the situation is ‘bent’ into
implementing a ‘satisfactory’ change into the material reality. So design
becomes the apparatus that informs value with the energy of its opposite.
‘Value’ can still be recognized, but there is also value accumulated in the
apparent rejection of it.
Think of the Louis Vuitton bag in both its authentic and fake versions.
Even though on a physical level they are yet to be differentiated, what
matters is that the bare existence of the fake points to the actual reason
for the outrageously high exchange value of the authentic. If it were
purely a matter of logic evaluation, the gap between the respective
exchange values of the authentic and the fake could never peak so high.
Without the fake we cannot detect any reason for the price being
substantially higher than the sum of all the (material and immaterial)
labour that it relies upon. To take the fake seriously literally means to
denounce the fakeness of the market value of the authentic model. The
mould of the fake bag is virtual. Sealed off from any recognized realm of
production, fabricated under the radar of the white market hierarchy, the
copy of the authentic only needs to operate as an image, as a container
of virtual attributes that are literally a bag of tags. The value of the copy is
the virtual value of the original.
In the documentary Carla’s List, prosecutor Carla del Ponte of the
UN International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia travels
to Belgrade and Montenegro to put pressure on local authorities to
hand over war criminals. The camera accompanies Del Ponte and
her colleagues on the airplane. It’s a tiny business jet and the view is
blocked by two huge bags. One is the Coco Chanel bag of the Tribunal’s
spokesperson, Florence Hartmann, the other is Del Ponte’s Louis Vuitton
bag. In this brief fragment of video the ostentatious display of French
fashion brands interrupts the carefully constructed image of international
justice hunting down Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. The bags are
not just expensive, their brand value (which is imaginary and speculative)
is written all over them. Thus as a view one may become suspicious of
the nature of an alliance between values and values.
The infrastructural channels that connect cities play a major role in the
construction of identities in the upgrading of certain areas and in the
marginalisation of others. A myriad of brands, brand remakes, unethically
cheap city trips, massive torrents of entertainment file downloads, and a
multiplicity of clothing and food brands, first function supplementary to,
but then gradually wipe out, historical structure. The visualized utopias
designed for and within real estate advertisements – the powers that turn
cultures into markets – create corridors between city centres that outgrow
their territorial relationship with peripheral countryside and villages, as if
they were part of another realm, which, from a virtual point of view, they
really are. The installation of an infrastructure of long-range connectivity,
and the simultaneous degradation of short-range (intra-national)
transportation and communication networks, can have disastrous
consequences. While globalization lands differently in each ‘destination’,
the reconfiguration of urbanism into centre-to-centre channels only
sharpens the rupture between centre and periphery, creating new walls
that can be seen as constituting inner borders.
As cities apply surface branding methods to build ever more channels
in the name of cultural diversity, only the so-called cultural cores of
cities get to enjoy the privileges of a cross-cultural exchange. These will
remain trapped in their own self-valorizing spheres. The onslaught of
city branding tags the wealthy inner cores with the seductive labels of
the virtual in service of global competitiveness. This regime is carried
out using names borrowed from emancipatory politics, which are used
to the opposite end: what it directly services is the annihilation of preexisting social bonds. New class divisions appear whose buying power ismobilized by, and transformed into the production of surface.
‘Third Way’ (post-Left and Right) politics have replaced the social body
by an endless spectrum of individual identities that no longer present
themselves as ‘we’, and can no longer be represented by the state or
addressed by politics (which progresses towards management and
benchmarking). As active consumers, individuals can account for their
existence and the relevance of the state purely through their economical
and virtual transactions. Sociologists in previous years had already drawn
the shapes of a post-Fordist political economy based on added value.
Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens – inventors of the Third Way – have
done so with a focus on the changing role of the individual and the self.
Scott Lash and John Urry summarize:
‘The thesis of the postmodern political economy is one of the ever
more rapid circulation of subjects and objects. But it is also one of the
“emptying out” of objects. For Giddens modernization is a process of
“time-space distanciation” in which time and space “empty out”, become
more abstract; things and people become “disembedded” from space
and time.’For Beck, contemporary society is a risk society which has shifted from
the distribution of ‘goods’ to the distribution of ‘bads’. These bads – risks
and threats – do not respect the old borders and divisions of race, nation
and class. Beck regards those globally distributed risks as unpredictable
events which equally affect rich and poor. For him the continuation of
modernity is the attempt to deal with these risks rationally now that much
of the former core structures of society have disappeared. Giddens sees
the project of individual identity as reflexive and in motion, continuously
integrating emerging information into the individual’s self-conception. His
nation state is one of ‘reflexively monitored systems’.
In all these transformations, an economy of design objects is implied;
objects are simultaneously lifted from their origin, tradition, space, time,
use-value, and exchange-value, in order to assume maximum agility in
the aggregration of new needs.
Design must be invested with the potential, the intelligence and the tools
to break down the new borders it has created by being borderless. It must
be invested with the energy to break through the seamless surfaces of
fictitious virtue which have become the new walls of the free world.
Before A Manifesto
We, the undersigned.
This sounds like a manifesto.
We take the manifesto to be a Utopian form.
Fredric Jameson distinguishes between Utopia as a genre (as, for
example, a written text, or a building, or a Utopian programme of
revolutionary change) and a Utopian impulse in daily life.
The ‘Online Etymology Dictionary’ traces the word ‘manifest’ back to
1374, as ‘clearly revealed’, coming from manifestus – ‘caught in the
act, plainly apprehensible, clear, evident’ – and manifestare – ‘to show
plainly’. It refers to manifesto, 1644 Italian, as a ‘public declaration
explaining past actions and announcing the motive for forthcoming ones’
– ‘originally “proof”, from the Latin manifestus.’
Manifestos are publicly stated decisions. They are written by those
who have made up their minds and shall now do as they have openly
declared. To write a manifesto is to put all of one’s cards on the table. To
write a manifesto is to draw up and sign a covenant with a self-declared
truth.
This is easier said than done. If a manifesto is a decisive political act,
its writers are out for some kind of power, even if such power is quite
minimal and temporary. As a manifesto is a statement of principle, it
demands a complete loyalty on the part of the undersigned. If the writers
diverge from the manifesto’s proposed path to the future, they are
either disloyal to their own text or they reveal that pragmatic action has
simply prevailed over principled decision. This weakens the impact and
credibility of a manifesto. If a manifesto is an attempt to gain power by
means of writing and publishing, it risks failing because of its potential
conflictuality with the hidden agenda which comes naturally to the
successful exercise of power.
Niccolò Machiavelli stated that ‘everyone realizes how praiseworthy it
is for a prince to honour his word and to be straightforward rather than
crafty in his dealings; nonetheless, contemporary experience shows
that princes who have achieved great things have been those who have
given their word lightly, who have known how to trick men with their
cunning, and who, in the end, have overcome those abiding by honest
principles.’
A printed object may carry the manifesto’s text in an efficient way, so
that people can either read it or hear about it, or both. Manifestos are
bound to the technology that provides their most effective mode of
dissemination. Régis Debray calls the historical period when socialism,
printed matter and the manifesto prevailed the ‘graphosphere’. For all
of its hubris and ambition, a manifesto is a shared text which exists in
the public domain as a printed original. In hopes of achieving action, a
manifesto usually relies on the frequent usage of commanding phrases
like ‘we must’, ‘we shall’ and ‘we will’.
But what happens to the manifesto in the age of television and the
internet, the ‘videosphere’, in Debray’s words? Does the manifesto have
any future when the paradigm of print has come to a close, which does
not mean the end of print but the end of the primacy of print? As Marshall
McLuhan says with regard to the passage from manuscript to print
culture: ‘print multiplied scholars, but it also diminished their social and
political importance’. In the same way, the internet multiplies publishing,
resulting in the diminishing of the status of what is published.
A manifesto is a text with political consequences; it seizes power, but
cannot be about power alone. One reason is that a manifesto’s writers
have usually not yet acquired much power; another reason is that as a
carrier of peaceful political violence, a manifesto depends as much on
poetry and song as it depends on argument. Formal issues are integral
to the aesthetic event that is a manifesto. Because the manifesto’s aim
is to interrupt, not to affirm, its mode of speech must differ from common
speech, to the extent that it allows for new words, new terms and
analogies, to render the established ones obsolete.
There are two principal typologies for manifestos.
The fortified structure of arguments, and the assembly of poetic decoys.
In 2000, the Canadian designer Bruce Mau wrote a manifesto about
design, printed it in a book, and published it on the internet. It is called
An Incomplete Manifesto for Growth. It is a numbered list of sentences
and process wisdom, not unlike the well-known type of statement which
says that ‘the first rule is that there are no rules’.
The Incomplete Manifesto for Growth’s 43 points include: ‘(1) Allow
events to change you. (2) Forget about good. (5) Go deep. (9) Begin
anywhere. (10) Everyone is a leader. (12) Keep moving. (13) Slow down.
(14) Don’t be cool. (15) Ask stupid questions. (19) Work the metaphor.
(18) Stay up too late. (25) Don’t clean your desk. (27) Read only left-
hand pages. (28) Make new words. Expand the lexicon. (35) Imitate.
(40) Avoid fields. Jump fences. (41) Laugh. And (43) Power to the
people’.
This is a manifesto of the poetic type, allowing for internal contradictions
and ironic deception. It places no emphasis on design as a professional
activity but instead pursues mistakes, nights without sleep, uncool work,
messy desktops, and laughter. (The dictum about the left-hand pages
comes from Marshall McLuhan). In doing so, it simultaneously taps
into Utopian form and Utopian impulse; Mau’s manifesto becomes a
programme centered around the transgression of programme.
The political consequence is that the commonly accepted separations
between professional and personal engagement are overruled. Design
is taken out of its limited mandate of professional operations, and is
brought into the realm of imagination, possibility and contradiction. The
manifesto promises that the most interesting ideas will arise out of the
lunatic reserve of the white night. This is the signal feature of artistic
manifestos; a most famous example, the Futurist Manifesto written in
1909 by Filippo Marinetti, mentions it right away.
‘We have been up all night, my friends and I, beneath mosque lamps
whose brass cupolas are bright as our souls, because like them we
were illuminated by the internal glow of electric hearts. And trampling
underfoot our native sloth on opulent Persian carpets, we have been
discussing right up to the limits of logic and scrawling the paper with
demented writing. Our hearts were filled with an immense pride at
feeling ourselves standing quite alone, like lighthouses or like the
sentinels in an outpost, facing the army of enemy stars encamped
in their celestial bivouacs. Alone with the engineers in the infernal
stokeholes of great ships, alone with the black spirits which rage in the
belly of rogue locomotives, alone with the drunkards beating their wings
against the walls.’
The Incomplete Manifesto’s hidden agenda is not without corporate
appropriation; the recommendation to perform night labour (preferrably
for Bruce Mau’s studio) carries its hidden agenda in an unstated (thus
Machiavellian) alliance with the post-Fordist practice of flexible labour
and maximized economic productivity.
‘We, the undersigned, are graphic designers, art directors and visual
communicators who have been raised in a world in which the techniques
and apparatus of advertising have persistently been presented to us
as the most lucrative, effective and desirable use of our talents. Many
design teachers and mentors promote this belief; the market rewards it;
a tide of books and publications reinforces it.’
The First Things First 2000 Manifesto (hereafter FTF) was signed by
33 graphic designers and was issued in 1999. It was printed in design
magazines and put on the internet. Re-reading FTF more than 8 years
after its release, it appears like a covenant of respectable professionals
offended by the degrading standards of their trade. In comparison, The
Communist Manifesto, first printed in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels, had more brutally stated: ‘Let the ruling classes tremble at a
Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their
chains.’ FTF made clear that it had no such modality of sacrifice to offer,
rather the opposite: nearly all of its authority was based the professional
achievement of the signees, who included Gert Dumbar, Ken Garland,
Tibor Kalman, Rick Poynor and Erik Spiekermann.
The manifesto continues: ‘Many of us have grown increasingly
uncomfortable with this view of design. Designers who devote their
efforts primarily to advertising, marketing and brand development are
supporting, and implicitly endorsing, a mental environment so saturated
with commercial messages that it is changing the very way citizenconsumers speak, think, feel, respond and interact.’
What do the undersigned offer instead?
‘There are pursuits more worthy of our problem-solving skills.
Unprecedented environmental, social and cultural crises demand our
attention. Many cultural interventions, social marketing campaigns,
books, magazines, exhibitions, educational tools, television programs,
films, charitable causes and other information design projects urgently
require our expertise and help. We propose a reversal of priorities in
favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a
mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and
production of a new kind of meaning.’
While there is no doubt about FTF’s sincere intentions, none of the
signees publicly refrained from well-paid or commercial work after its
release, none set out to make some sort of professional or personal
sacrifice that would purport realization of the aims stated, and none
changed the trade of advertising from without or within. Simply put:
nothing changed. FTF’s text, of the fortress type, proved easy to
conquer and dismantle for critics. Some of them hit home by targeting
the misrepresentation of commercial practice, pointing out that none of
the 33 undersigned, with the exception of Milton Glaser, had any real
experience in advertising and therefore were professionally unqualified
to attack it. Michael Bierut, a New York-based designer and partner at
Pentagram, writes that they ‘have resisted manipulating the proles who
trudge the aisles of your local 7-Eleven for the simple reason that they
haven’t been invited to.’ Michael Rock, partner at the New York-based
graphic design firm 2x4, takes a more subtle approach. Eventually he
cites the theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, targeting FTF’s
simplifications as ‘lite-radicalism’: ‘The identification of the enemy is no
small task given exploitation tends no longer to have a specific place and
that we are immersed in a system of power so deep and complex that
we can no longer determine specific difference or measure. We suffer
exploitation, alienation, and command as enemies, but we do not know
where to locate the production of oppression.’
Indeed FTF’s enemy is simplified, but so is eventually every enemy. The
point is that it is hesitantly and politely simplified. So that its signees are
not outraged, but ‘increasingly uncomfortable’. Not labourers but ‘art
directors’. Not selling one’s soul to the devil but ‘devoting one’s efforts
primarily to advertising’. And so on.
Some conditions at the time of writing of FTF were not put to the right
use. With regard to the manifesto’s general ties with printed matter and
the graphosphere, the authors of the FTF ommitted to realize that in
order to historically make sense it must relate to the internet, despite the
fact that in 1999 online advertising had hardly developed.
With regard to ideology, 1999 was as post-manifesto as one can get.
As British designer and writer Robin Kinross wrote about two years
after FTF, ‘the days of manifestos are over. In politics, no one much
believes in any sharp polarity of left and right. The difficulties of action
are immense. Keeping the boat afloat and away from the rocks seems
all we can do.’ Kinross accounts for the ideological tabula rasa of the
post-manifesto world and design’s general departure from ‘socially
engaged practice’, typical for the world after the fall of Communism and
the so-called crisis of the Left. The empty place left by the collapse of the
Left-Right opposition has been taken by a new concept, the ‘Third Way’,
crafted most prominently by the sociologists Ulrich Beck and Anthony
Giddens and implemented by New Labour in the United Kingdom.
Critics argue that the Third Way conceals hegemony by advocating the
nonexistent possibility of a rational consensus.
Can a design manifesto still be written from the ideological void? Now
that the principal tools of design – the computer and its software – have
been homogenized among practitioners and democratized among
people, professional distinction is an unlikely perspective for a future
design manifesto to gain support. User-generated content accounts not
for an amateurish supplement to a stable, professional core, but for a
fundamental transformation of the workforce and the value it creates.
The professional core of designers will not regain the central role it once
could claim based on its mastery of tools and services unavailable to
users. It seems instead more probable that among those professional
designers, a gap will increase between those who design as celebrity,
and those who design as labourer. Such a gap has already appeared
in the architectural profession. Subsequently, for a design manifesto, a
new alliance between designers and users may be a potentially more
succesful way forward. At the key of such a potential alliance is the
concept of immaterial labour.
Hardt and Negri define immaterial labour as producing ‘an
immaterial good, such as a service, a cultural product, knowledge, or
communication.’ For the sociologist Maurizio Lazzarato, the immaterial
labour of advertising, fashion and software development, comprises
‘intellectual skills, as regards the cultural-informational content; manual
skills for the ability to combine creativity, imagination, and technical and
manual labour; and entrepreneurial skills in the management of social
relations (...).’
A new common ground for designers and users is provided by the
changing links between production and consumption, of which
immaterial labour is the ‘interface’. The products of immaterial labour not
only materialize ‘needs, the imaginary, consumer tastes, and so forth’,
but also generate and produce new needs, imaginaries, and tastes,
so that the act of consumption is not the destruction of the commodity
but the establishment of a relationship which links production and
consumption (read: designer and user) together. Lazzarato holds the
social, aesthetic and communicative aspects of immaterial labour (which
for him extend into the act of consumption) capable of producing direct
social and political ties which escape traditional capitalist appropriation.
An example of the actualization of such ties is provided in The GNU
Manifesto, written by Richard Stallman in 1985: ‘I consider that the
golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other
people who like it. Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer
them, making each user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break
solidarity with other users in this way. I cannot in good conscience sign a
nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement. ‘
This manifesto (GNU being the acronym for ‘GNU’s not Unix’) stands at
the beginning of free software, open source and file sharing movements.
While different from Marinetti and Mau’s white nights, it crosses similar
boundaries. It declares the relationship between software developer and
user a social one.
Manifestos may require multiple decades of incubation time, as Régis
Debray accounts for with regard to the Communist Manifesto. On the
internet, a manifesto is no longer contained within a printed artefact
that protects its integrity. One may choose to read a manifesto only
partially, and one may encounter it while searching for something entirely
different. This should not harm the manifesto; ideally it should work
equally well from each of its sentences, so that in some ways, its fortified
structure of arguments becomes a distributed network.
